## Chapter 1: Java Fundamentals

### Final Modifier

- Local variables: 
  - Can only be assigned once
  - Must be initialized before it can be used
- Instance variables: 
  - Can only be assigned once inline, in initialization block or constructor
  - Must be initialized
- Class variables: 
  - Can only be assigned once inline or in static initialization block
  - Must be initialized
- Methods:
  - Can't be overridden
- Classes:
  - Can't be inherited
    
### Enum

- List of static enumerated members
- All values are each constructed, the first time any enum value gets called
- Can also have:
  - Instance variables (good practice: final)
  - Constructor (implicitly private)
  - Methods

### Nested Class

- Inner class
- Static nested class
- Local class
- Anonymous class

**Inner Class**:
- Can have any access modifier
- Can extend any class or implement interfaces
- Can not declare static fields or members except for static finals
- Can access members of the outer class including private ones
- Require an instance of the outer class to be constructed

**Static Nested Class**:
- Can have any access modifier
- Can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class
- Can't access instance variables or methods without a reference to an outer class instance
- The outer class can refer to methods and fields in the static nested class
- Creates a namespace
- Can be imported with a regular import

**Local Class**:
- Does not have access modifier
- Defined within a method and only exists when that method is called
- Can not declare static fields or members except for static finals
- They have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class
- They can access local variables that are effectively final

**Anonymous Inner Class**:
- Is a sort of local class, without a name:
  - Does not have access modifier
  - Defined within a method and only exists when that method is called
  - Can not declare static fields or members except for static finals
  - They have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class
  - They can access local variables that are effectively final
- Can't be abstract or final
- Can't both extend and/or have multiple interfaces
- Is created with an abstract class or interface as model
- Is a concise way of creating a class we use only once
- Was used more often before lambda expressions (with functional interfaces)

### Interface

**Members**:
- Constant variable
- Abstract method
- Default method
- Static method
- Private method
- Private static method

**Default Interface Method**:
- Can only be declared within an interface
- Must include a method body (default implementation)
- Assumed to be public
- Can't be abstract, final or static
- Can be overridden
- Must be overridden if another default method with the same name is inherited

**Static Interface Method**:
- Assumed to be public
- Can't be marked abstract or final
- Is not inherited

**Private Interface Methods**:
- Can't be used outside the interface
- Mostly to prevent code duplication
- Can only be called by default and other private methods

**Private Static Interface Methods**:
- Can't be used outside the interface
- Mostly to prevent code duplication
- Can also be used in static methods

### Functional Programming

Functional interfaces are used as the basis for lambda expressions in functional programming.
A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method.

**Functional Interface**:
- Can hold one abstract method
- Can override any amount of abstract methods from object
- Can hold any amount of other non-abstract methods

Predefined functional interfaces:
- Predicate
- ...

**Lambda**:
- Infers the types from the surrounding context
- Can use variables from 3 places:
  - The parameters
  - Local variables created in the lambda body
  - Variables outside the lambda referenced from the body
- When var is used in params, all params need to be var
- Variables referenced from the lambda body need to be effectively final
