## Chapter 2: Java Building Blocks

Primitives:
- boolean
- byte (8-bit)
- short (16-bit)
- int (32-bit)
- long (64-bit)
- float (32-bit)
- double (64-bit)
- char (16-bit)

Literals can have '_' to make reading big numbers more easy, but not:
- At the beginning
- At the end
- Near a comma

Identifiers:
- Start with a letter, $ or _
- Can hold numbers but not start with them
- Can't be a single '_'
- Can't be a reserved word

Var can only be used with single local variables:
- Not with instance~ or class variables
- Not in constructor or method parameters
- Not in multiple variable declarations

Scopes:
- Local variables: in scope from declaration to end of block, also in nested blocks
- Instance variables: in scope from declaration until the object is eligible for garbage collection
- Class variable: in scope from declaration until the program ends

An object is eligible for garbage collection:
- when it no longer has any references
- when all references have gone out of scope

Garbage collection:
- Can delete objects from the heap to release memory
- Can only be suggested (System.gc())
- Might never run

Finalize():
- Can run zero or one time(s)
- Was deprecated as of Java 9


## Chapter 3: Operators

Operator precedence:
- Post-unary
- Pre-unary
- Unary
- Multiplication, division & modulus
- Addition & subtraction
- Shift
- Relational
- Equal~ & not equal to
- Logical
- Short-circuit logical
- Ternary
- Assignment

Primitive numeric promotion in arithmetic operations:
- Will always promote primitives smaller than integers to an int
- Will promote the smallest of 2 operands to the larger one
- Will promote an integral data type to its floating-point equivalent when one of the operands is a floating-point

When assigning values:
- Casting to a larger datatype is automatic
- Casting to a smaller data type requires a cast, with possible loss of data

## Chapter 4: Making Decisions

**If-statements**:
- Can have only one else statement each
- Can be chained

**Switch-statements**:
- Can be of these data types:
  - Integer & int
  - Byte & byte
  - Short & short
  - Character & char
  - String
  - Enum
  - Var
- Case values should be:
  - Compile-time constant values (literal, enum or final constant)
  - Of the same data type as the switch value
  
**While-statements**:
- Might never run if condition is not met

**Do/while-statements**:
- Always run at least once, even if condition is not met

**For-loop**:
- Optional
  - Initialization statements
  - Boolean expressions
  - Update statements
- Code block

**Enhanced For-loop**:
- Iterable collection or array
- Single member data type and handle

*Flow statements*:  
break, continue & return

*Labels*:  
Optional in front of statements that allow flow to jump to or break from that statement

## Chapter 5: Core Java APIs

- String, StringBuilder & The String Pool
- Array
- List
- Wrapper class, Autoboxing & Unboxing  
- Set & Map  
- Math API

## Chapter 6: Lambda's and Functional Interfaces

**Functional Interfaces**:  
*Simplified definition*: Functional intefaces have only one abstract method.

- **Predicate**:  
A function used to return a boolean value.

      public interface Predicate {
        boolean test(T t);
      }

- **Consumer**:  
A function which takes in one argument and produces a result.
However, it doesn't return any value.

      public interface Consumer {
        void accept(T t);
      }

- **Supplier**:  
A function which does not take in any argument, but produces a value of type T.

      public interface Supplier {
        T get(); 
      }

- **Comparator**:  
A function used to compare 2 objects

      public interface Comparator(T o1, T o2) {
        int compare(T o1, T o2)
      }

  Has many other static and default methods for writing complex comparators.

**Lambda**:
- Are only allowed to reference effectively final values

Short notation:
  
      a -> a.System.out.println(a)

Full notation:

      (String a, String b) -> { return a.compareTo(b); }

Some API that take lambda's:
- removeIf(): Takes a Predicate
- sort(): Takes a Comparator
- forEach(): Takes a Consumer

## Chapter 7: Methods and Encapsulation

**Method Signature**:
- Access modifier
- Optional specifier
- Return type
- Method name
- Parameter list
- Optional exception list
- Method body

**Access Modifiers**:
- Private
- None (Package-private)
- Protected
- Public

**Optional Specifiers**:
- Static
- Abstract
- Final
- Synchronized
- Native
- Scriptfp

With **Method overloading**:
- Multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters.
- Type erasure will enforce type constraints only at compile time and discards the element type information at runtime.

Java handles method parameters as **pass-by-value**, which means we can't reassign parameter values inside a method.
However, we can call methods on them.

## Chapter 8: Class Design

Java only allows **single inheritance**. However, we can use multiple interface implementations,
or inner classes that inherit from a parent to get around this 'limitation'.

The **this** keyword helps us to reference an instance variable of the current instance.
This is useful when a method or constructor param share the instance variable name.

The **super** keyword helps us to refer to variables in the scope of a parent class.

**Constructors**:
- Do not have a return type
- Match name with the name of the class
- Can't have 'var' as params
- Can be overloaded, like methods
- Are called when creating a **new** object
- Will be provided by the compiler, when we do not (*default constructor*)
- Final instance fields must be initialized before the end of the constructor
  - In the same line
  - In an instance initializer block
  - In the constructor itself

We can use **this()** to prevent code duplication when overloading constructors.
- The call to this() has to be first in the constructor
- There can only be one
- Calling on other constructors has to end in a constructor not calling this() at some point (no infinite loops)

We can use **super()** to call parent constructors when inheriting.
- The call to super() has to be first in the constructor
- There can only be one

When **overriding** a method:
- It should have the same signature (if it doesn't, we are overloading or creating a new method)
- It has to be at least as accessible as the method in the parent class
- It should return the same type, or a subtype of the method in the parent class
- It can not declare exceptions that are broader than or new those of the parents

When overriding *generic* methods:
- The collection type has to match (or else you are overloading, instead of overriding)
- The generic type params have to match

When **hiding** static methods:
- It should have the same signature (if it doesn't, we are overloading or creating a new method)
- It has to be at least as accessible as the method in the parent class
- It should return the same type, or a subtype of the method in the parent class
- It can not declare exceptions that are broader than or new those of the parents
- Both methods should be static

*Final methods can't be overridden nor hidden!*

Because of **polymorphism** an object can be accessed using a reference of:
- The same type as the object
- A superclass of the object
- An interface that the object implements


## Chapter 9: Advanced Class Design

**Abstract Classes**: 
- Do not have to contain abstract methods
- Can not be instantiated
- Can hold all members a regular class can (variables, constructor, ...)
- Can not be final
- Can not be private or protected

**Abstract Methods**: 
- Can only exist in abstract classes or interfaces
- Can not have a method body
- Can not be more accessible than their concrete implementations (*Overriding rules apply!)
- Because it prevents the ability to be overridden:
  - They can not be final
  - They can not be private
  - They can not be static

**Implementing an abstract method = overriding.*

**Concrete Classes**  
The first concrete class to inherit from an abstract class:
- Must implement all inherited abstract methods from abstract classes
- Must implement all abstract methods from inherited interfaces

**Interfaces**:
- Are implicitly abstract and can't be instantiated
- Can only be public or package-private (like classes)
- Members are implicitly assumed to be public
- Variables are implicitly static final (or constant), and thus must be initialized
- Methods without a body are implicitly abstract
- Can hold:
  - Constant variables
  - Abstract methods
  - Static methods (Java 8+)
  - Default methods (Java 8+)
  - Private methods (Java 9+)
  - Private static methods (Java 9+)
- Can extend *multiple* interfaces! (unlike classes)
- Can not implement other interfaces
- Can not extend, nor implement any classes
- Files can hold only one public interface (like classes)

*Interface methods without a body are implicitly abstract.*  
*Default methods can have a body and do not HAVE TO be overridden.*

*Other methods that contain a body have to be either private, static or private static.*  
*An interface reference can be cast to any reference that inherits the interface,
although this may produce an exception at runtime when they are unrelated.*  
*The instanceof operator can only detect unrelated types if the reference on the left side is marked final.*

**Inner Classes**:
- Member inner classes
- Local classes
- Anonymous classes
- Static nested classes

**Member Inner Classes**:
- Access modifier is not limited to public or default, like in top-level classes
- Can't have static members
- The wrapper class manages the lifecycle of the inner class

## Chapter 10: Exceptions
- Object
  - Throwable
    - Error
    - **Exception**
      - **RuntimeException**
  
Exceptions:
- Checked: Anticipated* (Inherit *Exception*)
- Unchecked: Unexpected, but not fatal (Inherit *RuntimeException* or *Error*)

**We can catch both, but are only **required** to handle checked exceptions.*

Java **throws** exceptions:
- When code is wrong
- When stated by the code

Example:

    public String trySomething() throws Exception {
      throw new Exception();
    }

**throws**: Keyword used at the end of a method to indicate what exceptions it supports

**throw**: Used as a statement inside a code block to throw an exception

RuntimeExceptions:
- ArithmeticException
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- ClassCastException
- NullPointerException
- IllegalArgumentException
  - NumberFormatException

Checked exceptions:
- IOException
  - FileNotFoundException

Error Classes:
- ExceptionInInitializerError
- StackOverflowError
- NoClassDefFoundExceptions

**Exception Handling**:
- Try/Catch block (optional *finally{})
  - Chaining catch blocks: Handle each exception differently
  - Multi-catch block: Handle each exception in the same way

Example:

    try {
      // Code
    } catch (Exception e){
      // Exception handling
    } finally {
      // Final code
    }

**Finally blocks are typically used to close resources like files or databases.*

*We can't catch a subtype of an exception that was caught already by a supertype.
The code will not compile because it is unreachable.*

- Try-with-Resources (implicit finally{})
  - Automates closing used resources
  
Example:

    try (Resource r1 = new Resource; Resource r2 = new Resource){
      // Code
    } catch (Exception e){
      // Exception handling
    }

*These resources have to implement AutoClosable. A close() method has to be implemented,
which Try-with-Resources guarantees to run. It does NOT guarantee the resource will be closed.*

*The implicit finally-block runs before a finally-block written by the programmer.
In fact, it runs right after the try-block, before any catch~ or finally-blocks.
They are closed in the reverse order from which they were created.*

*Because a finally-block is implicit, the Try-with-Resources can exist of just a try-block.*

*For a catch-block to expect an Exception, a method in the try block has to actually be able to throw it.
If the exception or a subclass is not marked with *throws* for a method in the try-block, 
the code would be unreachable.*

**Overriding**:
- A subclass is not allowed to add new checked exceptions to the method signature
- A subclass can have less checked exceptions in the method signature
- A subclass can have subclasses of existing exceptions in the method signature

## Chapter 11: Modules

[Examples](https://github.com/boyarsky/sybex-1Z0-815-chapter-11)

*A module is a group of one or more packages plus a special file called module.info.java.*

Benefits:
- They provide a 'fifth level' of access control.
- They help with dependency management.
- Creation of smaller runtime images with jlink.
- Improved startup time, because Java knows what modules it will need.
- Enforcing of unique packages to prevent name collisions.
