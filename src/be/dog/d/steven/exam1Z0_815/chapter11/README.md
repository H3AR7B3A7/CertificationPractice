# Chapter 11: Modules

This file structure and the commands in Commandline.md have been adjusted (for a Windows system) to work in the directories you will find them.

Noticing some discrepancies in the original files provided by J. Boyarsky and S. Selikoff, I made sure the commands included in these files compile and package to jars as is. Jars are output to an 'out' folder so they do not conflict with the compiled classes in mods.

You can just open your favorite command line interface in the mods folder and just copy paste the commands from Commandline.md.
